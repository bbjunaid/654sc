1. To compile, type make in the folder where the Makefile, Client.java, and Server.java reside.

2. To run, open two terminals, one for client and one for server, and cd to the folder both are compiled in:

Terminal 1:
>> java Server

The server takes no parameter. When it runs, it will output an n_port which needs to be used when running
the client.

Terminal 2:
>> java Client <server hostname> <n_port outputted by server> <Message to reverse>

The client takes 3 parameters. The server hostname, which can be found by going to the machine which the server
resides on and typing 'hostname'. 

The n_port, which is output by the server program when it runs. 

Lastly, the message which needs to be reversed. It is recommended to input this message in single quotation marks,
ie. 'Hello' or 'Message to Reverse!'

Testing:
The version of make is GNU Make 3.81, and the version of javac is 1.6.0_20.

The client and server were tested on linux024.student.cs, and ubuntu1204-002 (linux.student.cs). Furthermore, they
were also tested on my own Windows OS, as well as Ubunutu 12.04.
